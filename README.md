+
To run this project follow the following steps:
1. Clone the repository: 
```git clone https://github.com/MANISH64CHAUDHARY/log4jminecraft.git```
3. Run the script log4j.py (```python3 log4j.py <ip_address>``` i.e. ```python3 log4j.py 192.168.1.132```). This installs the prerequisite software, and also starts up the LDAP server.
4. Run the script jcomp_pyserv.py (```python3 jcomp_pyserv.py```). This compiles the Java payload to be ran, and also starts a python3 http.server.
